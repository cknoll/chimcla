- `./jpg0`: These jpg files are part of the repo. For the preprocessing-unittests they converted to png-files (which are not part of the repo).
- `./raw_png`: Place where autogenerated png files are placed. These files are ignored via `raw_png/.gitignore` to prevent big binary blobs in the repo which would make it slow and unrepsonsive. Theses files are created by `TestCases1.get_png_dir` from the jpg files.
